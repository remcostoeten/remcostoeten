# About Me

I'm a Dutch software engineer specializing in front-end development. Currently, I'm building large-scale SaaS at Exact Online. My background includes open-source government projects, SaaS, and B2B/B2C e-commerce development with Magento 2.

My personal projects are primarily built with NextJS, TypeScript, and Postgres/SQLite, but I also dabble in React, Vanilla JS, Go, Python, Shell, NIX, Lua, and whatever is needed for the task.

# Current Projects

While I'm busy with full-time employment, I'm also working on two main projects in public:

## [RollYourOwnAuth](https://github.com/remcostoeten/nextjs-15-roll-your-own-authentication)

**RollYourOwnAuth** is a comprehensive, customizable authentication solution for the JavaScript ecosystem. It eliminates the need for third-party libraries like NextAuth, Clerk, or Lucia, allowing you to own your data completely.

  <summary>Features</summary>

  - **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens.
  - **Database Management**: Postgres sessions and management.
  - **Roles & Privileges**: Admin roles with specific privileges.
  - **User Management**: Email and password sign-up, social OAuth, user-profile management, and top-level user & session management for admins.

## [All-in-One Panel](https://github.com/remcostoeten/nextjs-lucia-neon-postgresql-drizzle-dashboard/tree/master)

**All-in-One Panel** is a dashboard that includes everything I need. Features are scattered across multiple repositories and local-only projects. Eventually, everything will be merged here. Unmerged features include finance management, note/code snippet management, calendar, custom auth, CSV parser (and other types), peripheral (mic, cam) tester & recorder, file storage vault, and much more.
